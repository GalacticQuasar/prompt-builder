## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- localStorage
- **IndexedDB** (for persistent configuration storage)
- Clipboard API
- ES6+ JavaScript features (async/await, Promises)

## Data Storage

The app uses two storage mechanisms:
- **localStorage**: Auto-saves current prompts for session continuity
- **IndexedDB**: Stores named configurations permanently with timestamps and metadata

Configurations saved in IndexedDB will persist even if localStorage is cleared or the browser cache is reset.
